There are problems building NetBSD sources on OpenBSD.
I've tested this on two different OpenBSD 6.9 machines.

Still open
----------
* Memory exhaustion building librt (amd64 & i386 X won't build)
During the build of LLVM librt on amd64 and i386, my 8G machine 
doesn't have enough virtual memory. This occurs when building xsrc
because the library is a prerequisite.

*. gcc failures on MIPS platforms
Gcc will not cross-build on the MIPS architectures.

Fixed
-----

1. PR#56179 - nbmakeinfo seg faults on building gccint.texi - FIXED 20210607
Turned out to be an out of bounds access that was only tickled when 
building in OpenBSD. Patch found in OpenBSD makeinfo & mainline.

2. PR#56180 - liblto_plugin is installed in the tools with a major & 
minor number 0. The toolchain expects it without a major and minor number. 
I believe this is simply the way that OpenBSD handles shared objects
- FIXED 20210628 (and 20210629 for gcc.old)

3. PR#56181 - sysinst will not build due to the check for formatting in 
one of the German messages files. This looks like a bug/feature/
characteristic of the OpenBSD sh running msg_xlat.sh in the count logic. 
I was able to get past this by using bash as HOST_SH - FIXED 20210629

4. macppc-fixcoff won't build - FIXED 20210623
When cross-building to macppc, this tool doesn't build due to repeated
definitions. By including the tool headers properly, this one is avoided.
