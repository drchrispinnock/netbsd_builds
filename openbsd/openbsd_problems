All platforms compile to release with X on OpenBSD 6.9 
(except sun2 but this is a general issue).

Workarounds needed
------------------

* Memory exhaustion building librt (e.g. when building X on amd64, 
  i386, evbarm64-el)
* gcc failures on MIPS targets

Both of these are caused by memory exhaustion. To workaround, either 
build as root or ask your friendly administrator to increase your
limits in /etc/login.conf:

	:datasize=infinity:\
        :stacksize-cur=8M:\

Fixed
-----

1. PR#56179 - nbmakeinfo seg faults on building gccint.texi - FIXED 20210607
Turned out to be an out of bounds access that was only tickled when 
building in OpenBSD. Patch found in OpenBSD makeinfo & mainline.

2. PR#56180 - liblto_plugin is installed in the tools with a major & 
minor number 0. The toolchain expects it without a major and minor number. 
I believe this is simply the way that OpenBSD handles shared objects
- FIXED 20210628 (and 20210629 for gcc.old)

3. PR#56181 - sysinst will not build due to the check for formatting in 
one of the German messages files. This looks like a bug/feature/
characteristic of the OpenBSD sh running msg_xlat.sh in the count logic. 
I was able to get past this by using bash as HOST_SH - FIXED 20210629

4. macppc-fixcoff won't build - FIXED 20210623
When cross-building to macppc, this tool doesn't build due to repeated
definitions. By including the tool headers properly, this one is avoided.
