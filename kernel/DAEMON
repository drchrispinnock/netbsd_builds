#
# GENERIC machine description file
# 
# This machine description file is used to generate the default NetBSD
# kernel.  The generic kernel does not include all options, subsystems
# and device drivers, but should be useful for most applications.
#
# The machine description file can be customised for your specific
# machine to reduce the kernel size and improve its performance.
#
# For further information on compiling NetBSD kernels, see the config(8)
# man page.
#
# For further information on hardware support for this architecture, see
# the intro(4) man page.  For further information about kernel options
# for this architecture, see the options(4) man page.  For an explanation
# of each device driver in this file see the section 4 man page for the
# device.

# On Mac laptops, several function keys double as "hot keys"
# (brightness, volume, eject) when the Fn modifier is held down.  Mac
# OS X likes to reprogram the keyboard controller to send hot key
# events when Fn is not held down and send function key events when it
# is.  This option transforms the non-keyboard "button" events back
# into function key events.
# enabled by default since trying to control brightness with those causes
# trouble on pretty much all halfway recent Apple laptops
